            The ring, lost for centuries, is found, and by a strange twist of
            fate, it falls into the hands of Frodon, a small Hobbit. Old Gandalf
            realizes that this is the special ring belonging to the Dark Lord
            Sauron. What Frodo must do is plunge into the realm of the Cracks of
            the Apocalypse to engage in an epic struggle and destroy this ring
